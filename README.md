Notes:
- lets start with 10 questions
- should the questions be focused on exercises or focused on explaining concepts?
- should we have code samples to describe concepts?
- are we coming up with our own answers, or using other resources, or both?
- should we just ask people in the study group what they want to know?  That was kind of what I was wanting to do...
